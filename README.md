Website design for the fictional Tarrant County College Baseball team and capstone/final project assignment for System Analysis and Design in Spring 2021 also at Tarrant County College. This is also a code scaffolding/design template for a video/informational website of an amateur baseball organization.

See the <b>Documentation</b> folder for more information. All of the links in the files are local, but feel free to change as needed. This repository is not complete and meant to be functional. Mostly just a proof of concept and code scaffolding for future work.
